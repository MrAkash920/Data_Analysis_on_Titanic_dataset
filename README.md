## Dataset Overview

The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset in the field of data science and contains information about passengers on the ill-fated Titanic voyage. It includes details such as passenger names, ages, genders, ticket classes, embarkation points, survival status, and more. This dataset is often used for exploring data analysis and machine learning techniques.

- **data/**: Contains the Titanic dataset in CSV format, split into training and test sets.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and visualization.
- **README.md**: The file you're currently reading, providing an overview of the project.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the required Python libraries and their versions.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python 3.x installed on your machine. We recommend using a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MrAkash920/Data_Analysis_on_Titanic_dataset.git
   cd Data_Analysis_on_Titanic_dataset

## Usage

You can explore the Titanic dataset and the analysis by opening the Jupyter notebooks in the **notebooks/** directory. To launch Jupyter Notebook, run the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook

## Analysis Highlights

Here are some of the key insights and analyses you'll find in this project:

- **Data Cleaning**: We'll start by cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and ensuring data integrity.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Discover interesting patterns, relationships, and visualizations about the passengers, their demographics, and survival rates.

- **Feature Engineering**: We'll create new features or modify existing ones to improve the predictive power of our analysis.

- **Predictive Modeling** (optional): If interested, we can build predictive models to predict passenger survival using machine learning techniques.

- **Visualization**: Throughout the analysis, we'll use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visually appealing plots and charts to communicate our findings effectively.
