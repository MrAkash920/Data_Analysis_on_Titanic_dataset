## Dataset Overview

The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset in the field of data science and contains information about passengers on the ill-fated Titanic voyage. It includes details such as passenger names, ages, genders, ticket classes, embarkation points, survival status, and more. This dataset is often used for exploring data analysis and machine learning techniques.

- **data/**: Contains the Titanic dataset in CSV format, split into training and test sets.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and visualization.
- **README.md**: The file you're currently reading, providing an overview of the project.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the required Python libraries and their versions.
